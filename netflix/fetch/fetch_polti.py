"""
This module contains a function to write a CSV file of dramatic situations.

based on Polti's 36 dramatic situations. The CSV file will have three
columns: "Number", "Situation", and "Description". Each row corresponds to
one of the 36 dramatic situations, with its number, name, and a brief
description. The output path for the CSV file can be specified through an
environment variable or defaults to "situations.csv" in the current directory.
