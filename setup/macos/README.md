# Development Environment for macOS

There are quite a few things you'll need to install in order to
get your project environment completely up and running.

## Local System Dependencies

Use [setup.sh](./setup.sh) to automate installation where possible. Use the
example [.zshrc](./.zshrc.example) as a reference for adding the necessary PATHs
and compiler and linker flags.

### Python Virtual Environment Dependencies

These low-level packages are only required for creating the local
Python virtual environment which itself is only used for syntax and type
checking inside of VS Code. That is, these are not actually used at run-time.
